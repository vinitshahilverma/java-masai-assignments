Q3/- How many types of relationships exist among tables in the
     Database? Explain with some examples, and also mention how to
     establish these relationships among tables with examples.
     
     
Answer:- There are 3 types of relationships among the tables.


       1) One to One:-
           Example:- Person with Driving Licence.
                     Person with Aadhar Card,
                     
                     
              we can stablish this relationship using foreign key in any one table.
              
              example:-
                       create table person
                       (
                        id int primary key,
                        name varchar(12),
                        address varchar(15)
                        );
                        
                        Create table DL
                        (
                        dlid int primary key,
                        issuedate date,
                        expDate date,
                        personId int unique
                        Foreign key (personId) references person(id);
                        );       
              
                     
       2) One to Many:- 
                        Manager with Employee.
                        Department with Employee.
                        Teacher with Student.
                        
                        we can stablish this relationship using foreign key in many table.
                        
                        create table department
                         -> (
                         -> did int primary key,
                         -> dname varchar(12) not null,
                         -> location varchar(12) not null
                         -> );
                         
                         
                         create table employee
                         -> (
                         -> empid int primary key,
                         -> ename varchar(12) not null,
                         -> address varchar(12) not null,
                         -> mobile varchar(12) not null,
                         -> salary int not null,
                         -> deptId int,
                         -> foreign key (deptId) references department(did)
                         -> );
                        
                        
       3) Many to Many:- 
                        Student with Courses.
                        Movies with Actors.
                        
                        
                        we can stablish this relationship using foreign key in the third table.
                        
                          create table Student
                          -> (
                          -> roll int primary key,
                          -> name varchar(12) not null,
                          -> address varchar(12) not null,
                          -> mobile varchar(10) not null
                          -> );
                          
                          
                          create table Course
                          -> (
                          -> cid int primary key,
                          -> cname varchar(12) not null,
                          -> fee int not null,
                          -> duration varchar(12) not null
                          -> );
                          
                          
                          create table Student_Course
                          -> (
                          -> roll int,
                          -> cid int,
                          -> Foreign key(roll) references Student(roll),
                          -> Foreign key(cid) references Course(cid)
                          -> );
