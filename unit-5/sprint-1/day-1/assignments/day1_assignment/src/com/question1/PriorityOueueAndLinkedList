Question 1: Explain difference between PriorityQueue() and LinkedList()?

Answer:- In priorityQueue when we try to add elements, they will get sorted on the basis of their natural order
          or as per the comparator function.
          
         While in the LinkedList we just add the elements and the order of insertion is preserved.
