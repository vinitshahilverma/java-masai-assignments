Question 4: Explain Generics in Java and Its Importance with example?

Answer:- 1) The main objective of Generics is to achieve typeSafety.
         2) It makes the code stable by detecting the bugs at compile time.
         3) Generics concept mostly used with the collection frame work related classes,but we can apply the 
            generics concept without collection frame work.
         4) Generics does not support primitive data it only supports objects.
         5) We can create our own generic classes or generics methods and that class or method can work with 
            any kind of data.
            
            
           Advantage of Generics:-
           
         1) Type checking at compile time.
         2) Get rid of down casting problem.
