          1)java.lang.ArithmaticException :- It occur when some of the number is divided by 0;
          
          2)java.lang.NullPointerException :- It occur when some of the value occurs is null and we try to print it.
                                            example-  
                                                    String str = null;
                                                    System.out.println(str); //NullPointerException.
                                                    
          3)java.lang.ClassCastException :- when we try to assign one type of class to another class.
          
          4)java.lang.ArrayOutOfBoundException:- when we try to access the array index which is not defined.
