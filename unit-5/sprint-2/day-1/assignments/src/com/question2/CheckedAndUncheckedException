Q2) Explain the difference between Checked and Unchecked exceptions. write some
examples of checked and unchecked exception classes.
       
Answer:- Checked Exception:-
         The classes which are direct child of the Exception class(except RuntimeException class) is known as checked exception class (including 
         Exception class itself).
         
         It is checked by java compiler whether we have handled that exception class object or not at compile time.
         
         For this compiler will force us to handle the exception.
         
         Example:-
         ClassNotFoundException
         IOException
         SQLException
         FileNotFoundException
         
        
         Unchecked Exception:-
         The classes which are direct child of RuntimeException including the RuntimeException class is known as unchecked exception.
        
         It is not checked by the java complier whether we handled exception class or not.
         
         For this compiler will not force us to handle the exception.
         
         Example:- 
         NullPointerException
         ArithmaticException
         ClassCastException
         InputMisMatchException
