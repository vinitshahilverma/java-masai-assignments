Q3/- What is the Serialization and deSerialization in Java ?

Answer:- Serialization is the conversion of the state of an object into a byte stream. which 
         we can then save to a database or transfer over a network.
         
         The reverse operation of serialization is called deSerialization where byte-stream 
         is converted into an object.
         
         The serialization and deSerialization process is platform-independent, it means you can serialize an
         object on one platform and deSerialize it on a different platform.
