Q2/- Whatâ€™s the difference between class lock and object lock?

Answer:- Class lock:- Thread need class level lock to execute static synchronized method.

                      It is unique for each class.
     
                      It can be used when we want to prevent multiple threads to enter the 
                      synchronized block in any of all available instances on runtime.
     
     
         Object lock:-Thread need class level lock to execute non-static synchronized method.
         
                      It is unique for each object of a class.
                      
                      It can be used when we want non-static method or non-static block of 
                      the code should be accessed by only one thread.
