Q2/ What is a ThreadPool, how to create a thread pool of 4 threads, and write down the
    difference between the Callable and Runnable interface.
    
Answer:-Thread pool is a pool of already created threads ready to do our tasks.
        With the help of the ThreadPool we can assign multiple tasks to a single Thread.

        We can create Thread Pool as follows:
        
        ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
        
        In the above statement we have created 4 ThreadPool.We can assign n number of task to few threads.
        This enhances the performance of our application.
        
        Runnable Interface:-
                             If a thread won't returns anything. 
                             only one method public void run().
                             return type void.
                             if any exception raise compulsory we need to handle within try catch.
                             Belongs to java.lang package.
                             from java 1.0 version.
                             
      Callable Interface:-
                            If a Thread returns anything.
                            only one method public Object call() throws Exception.
                            return type is Object.
                            not required to use try-catch.
                            Belongs to java.util.concurrent package.
                            from java 1.5 version.
