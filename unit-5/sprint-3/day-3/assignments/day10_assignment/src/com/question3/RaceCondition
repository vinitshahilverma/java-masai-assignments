Q3/- What do you mean by a Race condition, How to solve a race condition, give a proper
     example.
     
Answer:-A race-condition is a condition in which the critical section(a part of the program where
         shared memory is accessed) is concurrently executed by two or more threads.It leads to 
         incorrect behavior of a program.
         
         In layman terms, a race condition can be defined as, condition in which two or more threads 
         compete together to get certain shared resources.
         
         For example, if thread A is reading data from the linked list and another thread B is trying to delete the same data.
         This process leads to a race condition that may result in run time error.
         
         
         To solve the data inconsistency problem in java synchronized keyword is used.
         
         
         We can our code synchronized so that one by one thread can enter and there will be no chance of race
         condition.
         
         void fun1(){
          System.out.println("do something...");
         
          synchronized(this){--//here if a thread gets the lock of current obj then it is allowed to execute
          //this block
           System.out.println("do some more thing1");
          }

         }
