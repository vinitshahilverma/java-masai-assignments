Q4/ Explain about thread synchronization(inter-thread communication).

Answer:-It means two synchronized threads communicate each other.

Two synchronized thread can communicate each other by using some methods present in Object class, those
methods are wait(), notify(), notifyAll().

By using above methods we can gain partial control on the scheduling mechanism which is supervised by the
thread-scheduler.

To gain this partial control the threads should have a sign of mutual understanding between them .they should be
able to communicate with each other.

Whenever we need to suspend a synchronized thread unconditionally then we use wait() method.
Whenever we need to resume a suspended(waiting) thread then we use notify() method.

this is known as thread-synchronization or inter-thread communication.
