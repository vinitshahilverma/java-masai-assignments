Q5) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a Thread?

Answer:- When we extend Thread class, we can't extend any other class even we require.
         When we implement Runnable, we can save a space for our class to extend any other class.
         
         When we extend Thread class, each of our thread creates unique object and associate with it.
         When we implements Runnable, it shares the same object to multiple threads. 
         
         If we extend thread class than we can just create object of the class and start the run() through it.
         If we implement runnable class than we can create the object of the class and than and than we have to 
         create a new thread through it. And than we can call the start method through it.
