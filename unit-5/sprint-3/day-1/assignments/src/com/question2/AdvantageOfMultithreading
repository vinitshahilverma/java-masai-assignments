Q2) What are the benefits of using Multithreading?

Answer:- Benefits of Multithreading:-

         1. It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and we can perform multiple operations at the same time.
         
         2. We can perform many operations together, so it saves time.
         
         3.Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.
