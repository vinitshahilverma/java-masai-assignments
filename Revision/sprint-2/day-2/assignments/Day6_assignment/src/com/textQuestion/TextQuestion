Ques 1: Name some important classes available in java.io package?

Answer:- There are basically two types of classes in java :-

        1) Character Oriented Classes These type of classes is used to read or write a file which 
           contains only characters not binary data.
           
        2) Byte Oriented Classes These type of classes is used to read or write , copy or paste a 
           file which contains byte code like images.Ex:- ObjectOutputStream with fileOutputStream 
           for writing and ObjectInputStream with FileInputStream for reading.
           
Ques 2: Difference between FileReader and BufferedFileReader?

Answer:- FileReader:- 
         1) We have to read data char by char. 
         2) It doesn't need another reader object to communicate with file.
         3) Weaker performance Internally.
         
         BufferedFileReader:- 
         1) We have to read data line by line.
         2) It need another reader object to communicate with file.
         3) Better performance internally.
         
Ques 3: What is the most efficient way to read the content of a text file according to you in java?

Answer:- If we talk about java.io package then bufferedReader is the best reader according to me because 
         we can read complete line on one go.using methods likeBufferedReader 
         br=new BufferedReader(new fileReader("abc.txt"));String s=br.readLine(); //using this method.
         But if we talk about nio package then we have more powerful tools like path ,paths and file.
         using method like :-
             path p=paths.get("abc.txt");
            List<String> list= Files.readAllLine(p);
            
Ques 4: How to process binary file using java (i.e. reducing the pixels an image file).
        Give the rough idea on how would you process it using inbuild library/external libraries
        in java?
        
Answer:- Here to copy the file we use 

         FileOutputStream  fos=new FileOutputStream ("Location where the file has to store ");
         int i=fis.read();
         while(i!=-1){
         fos.write(i);
         i=fis.read();} //close and flush methods.
         
         We can use FileReader and Filewriter also but the image will not be copied successfully 
         since image is a byte oriented file not a character oriented file. 
         
Ques 5: Why there are unchecked exceptions are available in java if not complain by
        compiler. Why this segregation of checked and unchecked exceptions?
        
Answer:- There is segregation of checked and unchecked exception because there are some exceptions which the 
         compiler know can come so it warns in advance that a exception can occur to either handle it or declare it.
         Few Checked Exceptions are:- 
         1) IoException :- When there is a possibility that a file is not present at the given location.
         2) ClassNotFoundException :- When we don't know if the class id present or not.
         
        Few UnChecked Exceptions:- 
        1) ArthmeticException:- Occur when there is some calculation error.
        2) NullPointer Exception :- Occur when we over run a loop.  
        
Ques 6: Can you throw another exception from a Catch block. Write an example if yes

Answer:- Yes we can throw another exception from catch block.


         try {
			
            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
			
			System.out.println("Enter a number");
			
		    int y = sc.nextInt();
			
			int n = 20/0;
			
			System.out.println(n);
			
		}
		catch (ArithmeticException ae) {
			// TODO: handle exception
			System.out.println(ae.getMessage());
            
			throw new InputMismatchException("Please Enter valid input");
		}
