Question 1: How to convert a Array into ArrayList and vice-versa? Write example code snippet.

Answer:-  Array to ArrayList:-there are three ways:-

          1. List<> list = Arrays.asList(array);
          2. Collections.addAll(list,arr);
          3. using for loop;
              for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
                 list.add(arr[i]);
              }
              
          ArrayList to Array :- four ways
          
          1.for loop Normal.
          2.for loop enhanced.
          3.stream Api.
          4. arr[] = List.toArray();
          
Question 2: Why collections are used in java if everything can be implemented using Array? 

Answer:- 1. Due to dynamic nature of collections.
         2. we can only add homogeneous data in array but in collection it can both type of 
            homogeneous and heterogeneous.
            
     
Question 3: What are fail-fast and fail-safe collection iterations?
Answer:- Fail-fast iterator abort the operation as soon as it gets the failure but 
         fail-safe iterator doesn't abort the operation it tries to avoid the failure 
         as much as possible.


Question 4: Difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
Answer:- 
        Through Iterator we can iterate in unidirectional but through ListIterator we can iterate 
        in bidirectional.
        
        
Question 5: Explain the real situation use of HashMap, HashSet and LinkedList collections?

Answer:-  
          LinkedList used in music playList.
          
          HashMap use in contact list use to store person name  with mobile Number.
          
          HashSet use to store unique data like email id. Where we have to store only single copy.
