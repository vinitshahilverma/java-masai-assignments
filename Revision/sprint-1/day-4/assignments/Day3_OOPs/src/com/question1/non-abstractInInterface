Question 1: Can we have a non-abstract method inside an interface?

Answer:- Yes,from java-8 on-wards we can have default and static methods inside in interface.
         But this method should have a body.
         
         Example:-
         
         public interface Main {
	
	     default void trying() {
		    System.out.println("Inside the default method");
	     }
	
         static void fun1() {
    	    System.out.println("Inside the static method");
         }

         }
