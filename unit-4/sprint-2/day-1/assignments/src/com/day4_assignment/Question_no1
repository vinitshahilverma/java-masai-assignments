Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables?

Answer:- Variables which are define with static keyword known as static variable,
         while variable which are not define with the static key word known as non-static variable.
         
         Variables with static keyword are loaded to RAM statically, and we have to load the non-
         static variables dynamically into the RAM by creating the object of that class.
         
         Initially non-static variables are loaded into the hard-disk in form of the byte-code.
