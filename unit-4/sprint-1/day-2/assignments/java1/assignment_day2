Q1) Explain Type casting and its types with examples?

Answer:- The process of converting one data type to another data type is known as type casting.

Their are two type of type casting.

a) Implicit Type Casting:-

   The process of converting data from lower data type to higher data type is called as
     Implicit Type Casting.
     
   example :
         byte b=10;
         int i = b;
         System.out.println(b+" "+i);

         int i=10;
         byte b=i;
         System.out.println(i+" "+b);
         Status: Compilation Error, Possible loss of precision.
         
         byte b=65;
         char c=b;
         System.out.println(b+" "+c);
         Status: Compilation Error
         

        char c='A';
        int i=c;
        System.out.println(c+" "+i);
        Status: No Compilation Error
        OUTPUT: A 65
        
b)Explicit Type Casting:-

         The process of converting data from higher data type to lower data type is called as Explicit Type
        Casting.
        
         To perform explicit type casting we have to use the following pattern.
         P a = (Q) b;
         (Q) â†’ Cast operator
         Where P and Q are two primitive data types, where Q must be either same as P or lower than P .
       
        Example :
         int i = 10;
         byte b = (byte)i;
         System.out.println(i+" "+b);

         byte b1=30;
         byte b2=30;
         byte b=(byte)(b1+b2);
         System.out.println(b);
         
         int i=130;
         byte b=(byte)i;
          System.out.println(b);
         // -128, -127, -126 .... 0, 1, 2...... 127
          // 130 = 127+3
        Status: No Compilation Error
         OUTPUT: -126
         
         
         
         
         
Q2) Explain the difference between local and instance variables?

Answer:-The variable which is declared inside the class but out side the method is known as instance variable.

        The variable which is declared inside the method is known as local variable.
        
        
      Example:-  
      public class Demo {
	
	  // instance variable
	   int y = 20;
	
	   public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		 //local variable 	
		  int z =100;
		
		 System.out.println(x);
		
	}	
}
