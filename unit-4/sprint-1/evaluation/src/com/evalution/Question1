Q1) Explain why Java is platform independent?

Answer:- Java is platform independent because of JVM. JVM takes the java source code, compile it 

         and convert it into byte-code. The byte-code can be understand by any of the platform.
        
         Suppose we are working on the windows than JVM takes the source code and translate 
        
         it into byte-code which can understandable by windows in its native code.
         
         Similarly if we are on Mac or Linux JVM will translate the source code into respective 
        
         operating system understandable native code.
        
         This feature of Java made it platform independent.
