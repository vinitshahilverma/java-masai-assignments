Q2) Explain about HashCode and Equals Method.

Answer:- HashCode and Equals methods are like a best friend. They together implemented in the class,
         
         They both use to get override of the equals(). They both use make the object logically equal;
         
         HasCode takes the hasCode of the object and return new hasCode generated by it.
         
         And Equals to method returns the boolean value. It compare the elements of the object and 
         check it is logically equal or not and returns in boolean value;
         
         if equals method return true, than HashCode must be same of the Objects.
