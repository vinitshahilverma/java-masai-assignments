Q2) Why multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java at the class Level?

Answer:- Multiple Inheritance is not possible in Java at the class level because suppose we extends multiple 
         class to one child class. It may happen they have same method names and when we compile the file,
         
         Complier cannot decide which method it should inherit.It will go into ambigutiy state. To prevent this
         state it is not  possible to inheritance multiple classes to a single class.
         
         
         Also at Interface level actually class takes all the accountability of the methods from the parent 
         interface not the inheritance. That is why it is possible to implements multiple interface to a class.
