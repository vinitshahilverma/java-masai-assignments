Q1) Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList

Answer:- In ArrayList memory location of the element is contiguous.
         In LinkedList memory location of the element is not contiguous.
         
         In ArrayList if we delete a element from the middle than too many shifting
         operation are required.
         In LinkedList shifting operation are not required.
         
         
         ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.
         LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
         
         ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the data.
         LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.one for data,
         second for storing the address of the second data.
