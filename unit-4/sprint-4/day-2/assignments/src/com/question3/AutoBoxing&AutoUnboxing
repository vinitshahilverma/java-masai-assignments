Q3) Explain AutoBoxing and Auto UnBoxing with Examples.

Answer:-converting primitives into the object(box) it is known as boxing and reverse 
        is called unboxing.
        
         before java 1.5 inorder to add the primitives in the collection we need to wrap that
         primitives to their corresponding wrapper class object.

         int i=10;

         Integer i1= Integer.valueOf(i); //boxing

         int x=  i1.intValue(); //unboxing
         
         
         from java 1.5 onwords  we have a concept called autoboxing and autounboxing.
         Now java itself wrap the primitives into their corresponding wrapper class object.
         we need not to write full length name of the wrapper class

         int i =10;

         Integer i1 = i;  //autoboxing

         int x=i1; // autounboxing
