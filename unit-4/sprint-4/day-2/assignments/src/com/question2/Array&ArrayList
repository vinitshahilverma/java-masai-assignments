Q2) What is the difference between ArrayList and Array?

Answer:- The main difference between Array and ArrayList is that in Array we have to define the 
         size of the array initially before using. And in ArrayList we need not to define the 
         size of the ArrayList.
         
         In Array we can not add elements beyond it's size.
         In ArrayList we can add multiple objects without thinking about the size;
         
         In Array we can find the length by using Array.length;
         In Array we have to write Array.size() to get the length of the ArrayList;
