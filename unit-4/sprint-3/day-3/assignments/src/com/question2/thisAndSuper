What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keywords in java ? Explain with an example.

Answer:- this keyword is use to call the non static variable of the same class from the constructor of the same 
class while super keyword is use to call the constructor or the overriding method of the parent class from the child 
class constructor or Override method.Super keyword is a part of inheritance.

Both of them can only be used in the non static methods or non static Constructor.
