a) Does the below code compile successfully? If not, why?
  interface A{
   int i = 111;
    }
    
   class B implements A{
    void methodB(){
   i = 222;
   }
   }
   
   
   it will not compile because in interface the instance variable which are
   define are default final so it can't be initiated again.
   
   so we cannot reassign the the i in the implemented class as well.
