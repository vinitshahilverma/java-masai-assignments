Question:-Briefly explain the difference between Early and Late Binding with examples?

Answer:- 
          Generally method overloading is known as Early binding and method 
          overriding is known as late binding.
          
          method overloading is a part of static polymorphysim; 
          while method overriding is a part of runtime polymorphysim;
          
          
          In early binding methods have the same name but it will take different
          parameters;
          
          but in late binding, firstly it is acchived by inheritance. In the inheritance
          methods have same name, same parameter but it is overridden;
