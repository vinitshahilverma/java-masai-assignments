Q3) Explain the difference between abstract class and interface.

Answer:- By using Abstract class we achieve partial abstraction in Java.
 By using interface we achieve fully abstraction.
 
 
 Abstract class needs to be extended by another class while interface needs to
 be implemented by another class.
 
 Abstract class can have class members like,private,protected while members of
 interface by public abstract by default.
 
 In Abstract class multiple extends are not possible but in Interface multiples
 implementations are possible.
 
 Abstract class provides the implementation of interface while Interface doesn't
 provide the implementation of abstract class.
 
 Abstract class can extended by using "extends" keyword while Interface can be 
 implemented by using "implements" keyword.
