Q.Explain the Life-cycle of Entity class with example?

Answer:- Life-cycle of Entity has 3 state.


        1.NewState/transient state:-
        
               If we create a persistence class than this class is not attached with the
               EntityManager object, then this state is called newState/transient state.
               
               Example:- Account account = new Account(100,verma@gamil.com,dugda,1000);
               
         
        2.Persistence state:-
               If a persistence class object or Entity object is attached with the 
               EntityManager object, then this state is called persistence state.
        
               Example:-  em.persist(account);
               
        3.Detached state:-
        
                 If will call clear() or close() method on the EntityMangaer Object then 
                 all the associated object gets detached.
                 Due to application of this the Entity object will not remains in-sync with 
                 the table.
                 
                 Example:-
                 
                         em.clear()// Detached state and not in-sync.
                         
                          em.getTransaction().begin();
		  
		                  em.persist(account);// In-sync
		  
		                  em.getTransaction().commit();
