Q1/- Explain the Entity class life-cycle.

Answer:- An Entity class has the 3 life-cycle state:-

        1. New state/transient state:-
            If we create a object of persistence class and this class is not attached with the 
            EntityMangaer object then this stage is known as new State/ transient state.
            
            Example:- Student s = new Student(10,"Shahil",800);
            
        2. Persistence State:- 
            If a persistence class object or Entity object is associated with 
            Entity object, then this object will be in persistence state.
           
           Example:-when we call a persist(-) method by supplying Student entity object then at time 
                    student object will be in persistence state.
                    
                    or 
                    
                    When we call find() method and this method returns the Student Object,then that
                    object will also be in persistence state.
                    
         3.Detached State:- 
               When we call close() or clear() method on the EntityMangaer Object then 
               all the associated entity object will be in detached state.
               In this state the Entity object will not be in-sync with the table.
