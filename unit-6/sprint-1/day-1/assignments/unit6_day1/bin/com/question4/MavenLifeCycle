Q5. What are the different phases of the default life cycle?

Answer:- 
           1. validate: - In this phase it will verify the project diectory structure is valid 
                           or not. and it has pom.xml file is there or not.

           2.compile: Maven compiles all the source code of the project by downloading and adding
                       requied jar files in the classpath.

           3.test-compile: If we have written any unit test cases those code will be compiled.

           4.test : Maven will run all the test cases and it will show how many test cases are 
                    success and how many fails.

           5.package : Maven will bundle our java code into a jar file inside 'target' folder.

           6.install : That jar file in step 5 will be stored in the localrepo.

           7.deploy : Maven stores the application jar file to the central repo.

           8.clean : Here maven will delete and remove all the files that are generated in previous 
                     build. this phase is an isolated phase.
