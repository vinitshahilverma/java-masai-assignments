Q7. Explain what a Primary key, Candidate Key, Prime Attributes,
    and Non-prime Attributes is.
    
Answer:- 
       Example : -student(roll, name marks, address, dob, email);
       
       So all possible super key can be:-
       
       1.roll    
       2.roll name  
       3.roll name address
       4. name email
       5.email     
       6.name address
       7.address email
       8. dob email
       9.name dob
       
       Candidate key :- 
                It is the minimal set of super key.
                It should not have a subset as another super key.
                
                Example from above:-
                
                1)roll
                2)email
                3)dob email
                4)name dob
                
        Primary key:-
                 From the candidate key DataBase Administrator will choose a primary key, It is 
                 generally minimum number if attribute declared as Primary key.
                 Some time we can make other than minimum value attribute also as a Primary key
                 (composite key).
                 
       Prime Attribute:- Those Attribute which are part of candidate key is known as Prime Attribute.
       
       Non-Prime Attribute:- Those Attribute which are not the part of candidate key is known as 
                             Non-Prime Attribute.
