Q1. When should one use Maven?

Answer:- Developers have multiple responsibilities like :- 

       1)write some source code(bunch of classes, inteface...).
       2)Add some external  jarfiles to the classpath (dependencies of our application)
         in JDBC dao project, driver jar file is the dependency of our project.
       3)Compile the code.
       4)Prepare some test cases. (Unit test, Junit, Mockito, Sonar ).
       5)Add Junit/mockito related jar files inside the classpath.
       6)compile  and run the test cases.
       7)arrange our code in a standard folder structure

         Java based Webapplication:
          ----------------------------------

         *.java
         *.class
         *.jar
        *.html

       8.Do the packaging : build the jar, war file. 
       9.deploy this jar file/ war file to the server.
       
       If developer do any of the mistake than they needs to repeat the process again and again.
       So,Maven is a tool that can now be used for building and managing any Java-based project. 
       It makes the day-to-day work of Java developers easier and generally help with the 
       comprehension of any Java-based project.
