Q4 Explain the properties of JPA(Java Persistence API)?

Answer:- JPA represents a simplification of the persistence programming model.
         The JPA specification explicitly defines the object-relational mapping,
         rather than relying on vendor-specific mapping implementations.
         
         JPA standardizes the important task of object-relational mapping by using annotations or XML to 
         map objects into one or more tables of a database.
         
         To further simplify the persistence programming model:
         
        -The EntityManager API can persist, update, retrieve, or remove objects from a database.
        
        -The EntityManager API and object-relational mapping metadata handle most of the database 
          operations without requiring you to write JDBC or SQL code to maintain persistence.
          
        -JPA provides a query language, extending the independent EJB querying language (also known as JPQL),
         that you can use to retrieve objects without writing SQL queries specific to the database that you 
         are working with.
