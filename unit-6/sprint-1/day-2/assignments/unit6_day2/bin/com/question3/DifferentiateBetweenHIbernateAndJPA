Q3. Differentiate between Hibernate and JPA.

Answer:-JPA is a specification and Hibernate is its one of the famous implementation.

        Hibernate:-It is ORM based framework software.
        
                   Hibernate is one of the most frequently used JPA implementation.
                   
                   Hibernate provides its own API to develop ORM based persistence logic, if we use
                   those API then our application will become vendor lock, i,e we can not port our
                   application across multiple ORM software.
                   
                   Hibernate comes in the form of org.hibernate package.
                   
        JPA:- It is an open specification given by Oracle crop, to develop any ORM based Software.
              
              JPA provides a standard API to work with any kind of ORM base Software.
              
              Java API belongs from "javax.persistence" package.
