Q5. Why to use ORM and What are the benefits of ORM?

Answer:-

       2.it supports POJO and POJI model

       3.It is a lightweight s/w because to execute the ORM based application we need not install 
         any kind of servers.

       4.ORM persistence logic is DB independent. it is portable across multiple DB software.
       (because here we deal with object, not with the SQL queries)
 
       5.Prevent the developers from boiler plate code coding to perform CRUD operations.

       6.It generates fine tuned SQL statements internally that improves the performance.

       7.It provides caching mechanism (maintaining one local copy to enhance the performance)

       8.It provides implicit connection pooling.

       9.Exception handling is optional because it throws unchecked exceptions.

       10.It has a special Query language called JPQL (JPA query language ) that totally depends upon the '
       objects.
