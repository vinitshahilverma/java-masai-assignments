Qn2:-Limitation of JDBC based persistence logic over JPA?

Answer:- 
         1.JDBC can't store the java objects into the table directly,because SQL queries does not 
           allows the java objects as input, here we need to convert object data into the simple
           (atomic)value to store them in a DB.
           
         2.JDBC code is the Data Base dependent code because it uses Data Base software dependent 
           queries. So our JDBC based persistence logic is not 100% portable across various DataBase
           Software.
           
           
        3.JDBC code having boiler plate code problem (writing the same code except SQL queries in 
          multiple classes of our application again and again).
          
        4.JDBC code throws lots of checked exceptions, programmer need to handle them.
        
        5.After the select operation, we get the ResultSet object.this RS object we can not transfer 
          from one layer to another layer and to get the data from the ResultSet we need to know the 
          structure of the ResultSet.
          
        6.There is no any caching and transaction management support is available in JDBC.
