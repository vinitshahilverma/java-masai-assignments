Q6 what is Core Components of Hibernate explain?

Answer:- Below are the important elements of Hibernate

       1)hibernate.cfg.xml: This file has database connection details.
       
       2) hbm.xml or Annotation: Defines the database table mapping with POJO. 
          Also defines the relation between tables in java way.
          
        3)SessionFactory:
             There will be a session factory per database.
             The SessionFacory is built once at start-up.
             It is a thread safe class.
             SessionFactory will create a new Session object when requested.
             
       4)Session:
             The Session object will get physical connection to the database.
             Session is the Java object used for any DB operations.
             Session is not thread safe. Hence do not share hibernate session between threads.
             Session represents unit of work with database.
             Session should be closed once the task is completed.
