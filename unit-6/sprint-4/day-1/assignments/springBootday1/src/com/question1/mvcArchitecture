Q1/- Explain the Java-based Spring MVC architecture.

Answer:- In the webServer their is a web container software is there .
         When ever client will give the request.Intially one servlet is their.
         Request is trapped by the servlet implemented class.
         
         Servlet capture the user input than it validate the input.
         
         After that to process the data it will take the help of service layer class.
         it process the data and try to communicate with data access layer class.
         
         DAL class basically communicate with database.
         
         After performing the task database give the data to the data access layer and DAL give 
         the data to the  service layer and service give the data  to the Servlet layer.
         
         Instead of generating the data directly servlet will keep it to the repository and forward the 
         control to the JSP.
         
         And JSP will give response to the client.
         
         JSP is taking care of View.
         Servlet is working as the Controller.
         Model is Java Bean class+ Service Layer + Data Access Layer.
