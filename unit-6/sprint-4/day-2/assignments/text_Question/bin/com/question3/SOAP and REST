Q3/- What is the difference between SOAP and REST ?

Answer:-
          
          SOAP:-
          ===============
          
          Soap stands for simple object access protocol.
          
          SOAP is a protocol.
          
          SOAP permits XML data format only.
          
          SOAP can't use REST because it is a protocol.
          
          SOAP uses services interfaces to expose the business logic.
          
          JAX-WS is the java API for SOAP web services.
          
          SOAP requires more bandwidth and resource than REST.
          
          SOAP defines its own security.
          
          SOAP is less preferred than REST.
          
          REST:-
          ===========
          
          REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
          
          REST is an architectural style.
          
          REST permits different data format such as Plain text, HTML, XML, JSON etc.
          
          REST can use SOAP web services because it is a concept and can use any protocol like HTTP, SOAP.
          
          REST uses URI to expose business logic.
          
          JAX-RS is the java API for RESTful web services.
          
          REST does not define too much standards like SOAP.
          
          REST requires less bandwidth and resource than SOAP.
          
          RESTful web services inherits security measures from the underlying transport.
          
          REST more preferred than SOAP.
