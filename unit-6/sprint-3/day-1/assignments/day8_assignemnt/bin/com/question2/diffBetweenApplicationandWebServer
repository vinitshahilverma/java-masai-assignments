Q2/- What is the difference between an Application Server and a Web server?

Answer:- 1) Java based webserver is the small part/ subset of the ApplicationServer.

         2) Application server contains both EJB container and ServletContainer software where 
            as webserver software contains only ServletContainer software, it does not contains 
            EJB-container.
            
         3) Application software can be communicated with any kind of protocol example:- http,
            smtp, ftp , etc. whereas Web Server can be communicated only using Http protocol.
            
         4) Application software is a heavy weight server where as Web Server is a lightweight 
            server.
