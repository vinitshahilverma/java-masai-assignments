Q4/- Write Short notes on how the Spring framework evolves.

Answer:-  Spring frame allows to write the business logic in a POJO classes, and 
          Spring Container provides the middle ware services to our main business 
          class with less process overhead.
          
          so our business logic related classes need not implement or extends any other 
          classes or interfaces or override any unnecessary methods.  no need to install 
          ApplicationServer software.
          
          unlike EJB container, Spring container is a lightweight container, can be activated 
          in any type of Java application (need not install ApplicationServer software).
