Q/- What is a Spring Bean and Spring container? How to activate the Spring Container in our
    application.
    
Answer:-  Spring Bean:- Any bean class which is register with the "Spring container Software"
           is known as Spring bean. The Spring bean is basically a POJO class.
           
          Spring Container:- In Spring Application, A pure java class that controls all the
          spring beans is known as spring container. Other container like J2EE we need not to 
          install any server for this.
          
          The Spring container is a lightweight container.It can be activated in any kind of 
          server.
          All the core functionalities provided by the spring framework are available through 
          the spring container only.
          
          Spring configuration file:
          
          In the spring application, the spring container creates the object of spring beans,
          injects the dependencies to the dependent and manages the life cycle of the spring bean.
          
          To tell the spring container about our application classes and their dependencies,
          we must configure our classes into an XML file which is called a spring configuration file.
          
          We register any java class with the spring container, using this configuration file only. 
          then that java class will become a spring bean.
          
          We can give any name to this XML file but the recommended name is (applicationContext.xml).
