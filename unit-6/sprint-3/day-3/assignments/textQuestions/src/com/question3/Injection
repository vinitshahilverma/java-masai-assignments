Q3/- What is the difference between setter injection and constructor injection?

Answer:- 

        Constructor Injection:- 
        
        It may cause circular dependency.
        If the dependency is mandatory.
        If the dependency is "final" variable then.
        It must be injected through the constructor injection only.
        constructor injected values will be accessible to setter method.
        constructor injected value can not override the setter injected value.
        
        Setter Injection:- 
        
        It resolve the circular dependency.
        If the dependency is optional.
        We can not inject the final variable through the setter.
        Setter injected value can not be accessible through the constructor.
        It can override the constructor injected value.
