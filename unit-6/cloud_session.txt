1. deploying our spring boot application on cloud :
Railway cloud:

2. Rest clients : 
1. RestTemplate
2. WebClient
3. OpenFeign

Deploying Spring Boot application to the Railway cloud:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

step1: develop a spring boot application with all the end points
and test it on local system.

step2: push that application to the github repository

step 3: open the Railway cloud website and signup 

step 4: create a db instance on the Railway cloud.

Note: optionally we can connect that cloud db with our local mysql client and 
can choose database "railway" and we can create tables and insert records with
our choice.



step 5: get the db environment variables, which we have mentioned inside 
the application.properties file from the mysql instance variables tab.


DB_HOST=containers-us-west-200.railway.app
DB_NAME=railway
DB_PORT=7155
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=DwzV0MOysUoBLmCuGa7l


step6: create an application inside the Railway cloud from github repository.

Step 7: update all the environment variables accoringly. (it automatically redeploy our application with updated variables)
